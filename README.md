# Create and deploy a Swift Web Application using Kitura

> We have similar applications available for [Node.js](https://github.com/IBM/nodejs-web-app), [Java Spring](https://github.com/IBM/spring-web-app), [Go](https://github.com/IBM/go-web-app), Python [Django](https://github.com/IBM/django-web-app) & [Flask](https://github.com/IBM/flask-web-app), and [Java Liberty](https://github.com/IBM/java-liberty-web-app).

In this sample application, you will create a basic web application using [Kitura](https://www.kitura.io/) to serve web pages in Swift, complete with standard best practices, including a health check and application metric monitoring.


## Steps

You can [deploy this application to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/starter-kits/ad373fa7-330f-32a3-8f9e-d2d2649497ed/swift-web-app-with-kitura) or [build it locally](#building-locally) by cloning this repo first.  Once your app is live, you can access the `/health` and `/swiftmetrics-dash` to build out your cloud native application.

### Deploying to IBM Cloud

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy/button.png)](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/starter-kits/ad373fa7-330f-32a3-8f9e-d2d2649497ed/swift-web-app-with-kitura)

Use the button above to deploy this same application to IBM Cloud.  This option will create a deployment pipeline, complete with a hosted Git lab project and devops toolchain.  You will have the option of deploying to either CloudFoundry or a Kubernetes cluster. [IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside IBM Cloud. 


### Building Locally

To get started building this application locally, you can either run the application natively or use the IBM Cloud Developer Tools for containerization and easy deployment to IBM Cloud.


#### Native Application Development

- On Linux, install the [Swift toolchain](https://swift.org/) version _v5.0_.
- On macOS, install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download) _v10.2+_

In the root of this project, first build the application using `swift build`. `swift run` will launch the application and render it at `http://localhost:8080`.

#### IBM Cloud Developer Tools

Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli/index.html#overview) on your machine by using the following installation command: `curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash`.

Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build
ibmcloud dev run
```

This will launch you application locally.  When you are ready to deploy to IBM Cloud, use the `bx dev deploy -t buildpack` or `bx dev deploy -t container` to deploy to CloudFoundry or Kubernetes, respectively.

You can build and debug your app locally with:

```bash
ibmcloud dev build --debug
ibmcloud dev debug
```
